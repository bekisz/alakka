## Replicator Features  
* replication speed (chance of replications/time unit)
   * (gene, env) => replication coefficient -> chance of replication 
   * 
    
* resilience ( resistance to decay) (chance of decay /time unit)
  * gene -> resilience coefficient -> chance of replicator instance survival


Probability of Survival (till a certain time)
* Resistance : P(decay) = 0
* Replication :
